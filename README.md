# My Personal Project

## Card Collector

This application will be designed for people with an interest in collecting and keeping track of their trading cards.
Personally, I collect cards for the sake of using them in games with my friend's but the program will be more general.
For the sake of sticking to what I'm more knowledgeable about, I'll loosely base the cards off of *Magic: The Gathering*
since this is what interests me. I enjoy playing card games like *MTG* and as a result, I find this project would be
helpful and interesting to me. **The application will allow users to enter cards into collections as they collect them,
and sort them into decks at any point to help with deck planning. It should help the user with finding their desired
cards and make sure their deck is standard according the ruleset they're currently applying to the deck. A collection
should be all the cards owned by the user, whereas a deck will be a certain subset of those cards of arbitrary size
that fits selectable restrictions. (Most rulesets have limits on the card count in a deck, but I'll add one with no
additional rules to allow for an arbitrary deck size with no restrictions)**
